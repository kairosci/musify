## Design Principles

### Inspired by Metrolist
This app follows the design and UX principles of Metrolist:
- Clean, modern interface
- Music streaming focus (no video content)
- Library management
- Background playback support
- Offline capability (download support structure)
- **P2P Sync** - Account-free synchronization inspired by Brave browser

### Spotify-like UX
- Bottom navigation with Home, Search, Library tabs
- Mini player that appears when playing music
- Full-screen player with gesture controls
- Grid and list views for content
- Horizontal scrolling carousels
- Quick access grid for recent content

### Color Scheme

- **Background**: Dark (#121212)
- **Surface**: Dark gray (#1E1E1E)
- **Cards**: Slightly lighter gray (#282828)

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Flutter 3.x
- **State Management**: Provider
- **Audio**: just_audio, audio_service
- **Storage**: Hive, SharedPreferences
- **Networking**: http
- **Image Caching**: cached_network_image

## Screenshots

The app features:
- A modern home screen with personalized recommendations
- Search functionality with category browsing
- Library management with filters

## Testing

Run tests with:
```bash
flutter test
```

## P2P Sync Feature

Flyer includes a peer-to-peer synchronization feature inspired by Brave browser's sync functionality. This allows you to sync your music library across multiple devices without creating an account.

### How It Works

1. **Start a New Sync Chain**: On your first device, create a new sync chain. You'll receive a 24-word sync code.
2. **Save Your Sync Code**: Store this code securely - it cannot be recovered!
3. **Connect Other Devices**: Enter the same 24-word code on your other devices to join the sync chain.
4. **Choose What to Sync**: Select which data to sync (liked songs, playlists, settings, etc.)

### Privacy Features

- **No Account Required**: Your data is never associated with an email or account
- **End-to-End Encrypted**: Only devices with the sync code can read your data
- **Decentralized**: Data syncs directly between devices via P2P
- **Full Control**: Remove devices or leave the sync chain at any time

### Supported Platforms for Sync

- Windows
- Linux  
- macOS
- Android
- iOS
- Web
